__Assignment1:__
1. You will create ad class called "CodeExecutor"
2. Create an interface called generics.IMapper. This has one method called 'map' which just takes one argument and returns the 
    same type back. i.e. if one inputs string output will be string but value could have been changed. 
3. This has one instance method called 'mapAndPrint'. This should accept a list as one argument and second object of class 
    implementing generics.IMapper.
4. Write one of the implementation of this interface which takes string as input, replaces all characters 'a' with 'b'.
5. Write second implementation of this interface which takes int as input and squares the number and returns it.
